## Tutorial

This is a tutorial for manually creating an imretro file.

### Prerequisites

We'll use `xxd` in this tutorial. `xxd` is a command that can
convert between text and hex dumps. `xxd` comes with the
`vim-common` package and Git for Windows, so you may already
have it installed.

You can still follow along with the tutorial without having
`xxd` by using your favorite hex editor. The general ideas
of the tutorial should be the same.

## 2-Bit Pixels (And Palettes)

Pixels, now with 100% more bits! The 2-bit pixel mode supports 4 distinct
colors. This is inspired by the color support of
[the original Game Boy][Game Boy specs].

### Differences From 1-bit Pixel Mode

#### The Mode Byte

In the [previous tutorial], an imretro image with 1-bit mode was made. Looking
at the [imretro docs][mode byte docs], we can see that 2-bit pixel mode is
activated by setting the first 2 bits (from the left) to `01`.

#### Pixels

This is pretty obvious, but in 2-bit pixel mode, each pixel takes 2 bits, for 4
pixels per byte.

### Making The Image

So let's make an image! Like before, we'll start with the signature.

```console
$ printf "IMRETRO" > mystery-character.imretro
```

Now, for the mode byte, we know we should set pixel mode to `01`. But let's do
something extra. Each imretro file can optionally contain its own palette, to
be used if the defaults aren't sufficient. We signify that the image comes with
its own palette by setting the 3rd bit from the left. So our byte will be
`01100000`. In octal, that's `140`.

```console
$ printf "\140" >> mystery-character.imretro
```
